PYTHON TASK 4 - Program Descriptions
-----------------------------------

This report explains the purpose and logic used in each Python program from Task 4. All explanations are written in a simple and understandable manner.

1. Task 25: Find Missing Number
--------------------------------
This program finds the missing number from a list of numbers that should contain values from 1 to n+1. 
It calculates the expected sum of all numbers and subtracts the actual sum from it to find the missing one.

2. Task 26: Check Balanced Parentheses
--------------------------------------
This script checks whether the parentheses in a string are balanced.
It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with closing ones as they appear.

3. Task 27: Longest Word in a Sentence
--------------------------------------
The program splits a sentence into words and finds the word with the maximum length.

4. Task 28: Count Words in a Sentence
-------------------------------------
This script counts how many words are present in a sentence by splitting the sentence by spaces.

5. Task 29: Check Pythagorean Triplet
-------------------------------------
Given three numbers, this program checks whether they form a Pythagorean triplet (a² + b² = c²).
It first sorts the numbers so that the largest is assumed to be 'c'.

6. Task 30: Bubble Sort
-----------------------
This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The list becomes sorted after multiple passes.

7. Task 31: Binary Search
-------------------------
This efficient algorithm searches for a target number in a sorted list.
It repeatedly checks the middle of the list and narrows down the search range by half.

8. Task 32: Find Subarray with Given Sum
----------------------------------------
This script finds a continuous section of the list (subarray) that adds up to a given number.
It uses the prefix sum technique and a dictionary to track the indices.

9. Task 4: Log Analysis System
------------------------------
This program analyzes a web server log file.
It counts how many times each IP address accessed the server, how many times each URL was visited, and how many times each response code occurred.
This helps understand user behavior and monitor website traffic.
